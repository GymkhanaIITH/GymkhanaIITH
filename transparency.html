						<h2>Weekly report</h2>
<em>May 22 2016</em><br>
						<em><u>Hostel Complaints:</u></em> 
						<p>
							<br>1. Internet issue at ODF -- Internet has been restored. If there is any problem, please let us know. 
							<br>2. Mirrors is 800 and 900 series washrooms -- Mirrors are to be allotted by Estate Office. So we have requested for new mirrors. 
							<br>3. Night Canteen and Juice shops being closed on Sundays -- As per the tender, juice shop can be closed on Sundays. We will let you know about night canteen. 
						</p>  <br>
						<em><u> Mess Complaints:</u></em> 
						<p>
							<br>1. Limiting the amount of special items served (Paneer curry, Sweet, etc) -- It is obvious that all of us (students) like special items. But those items will be served in limited quantities only.
						</p><br>
						<em><u>Transport Complaints:</u></em> 
						<p>
							<br>1. Cabs during lunch hours are full -- For this reason, 12:30PM bus which is from ODF to Kandi and 1:30PM bus which is from Kandi to ODF are arranged to run via labs. 
							<br>2. During weekends many people are going from Labs to ODF at 8:30PM. So please arrange a bus at that hour to run via lab -- It is arranged as suggested. 
							<br>3. Arrangement of buses from Kandi to ODF insti at 9 or 10AM and ODF insti to Kandi at 7 or 8PM-- We will look into this and arrange within 2 or 3 days.
							<br>4. 8:30PM bus from Kandi to ODF did not go via labs -- We spoke with the drivers about this. We will ensure that this will not happen again. 
							<br>5. Absence of 9:45PM cab driver on 18-05-2016 -- We will speak with the can driver and avoid these issues from happening again. 
							</p><br>
						<em><u>Suggestions:</u></em>
						
							<br><h4>Suggestion 1:</h4><p>The library does not have a reference room at present. There are no chairs available to sit. Please arrange atleast a temporary reference room for the library:-</p>
								<br><h4>Response:</h4><p>One of the most peaceful places to sit and study is Library. But in our library, there is no place to sit. It is completely filled with books. So it is not really possible to arrange chairs inside. A room close to library is required to make use of it as a study room. But there is no room close to library. There will be problems in taking the book, if the room is not close to the library. So we are working on how to set up a room. We also welcome you to suggest if you have any idea or solution for this. </p>
							<br><h4>Suggestion 2:</h4><p>In Kandi-ODF schedule at night times, there is only half hour gap for the same bus to come from ODF and to go back to ODF and the buses scheduled like this are late by 10-15 minutes daily:-</p>
								<br><h4>Response:</h4><p>We will look into this and make necessary changes.   </p>

					<p>You might not be able to see the flow from outside, but believe us it exists! If you support us (in good) and advise us (in our mistakes) instead of criticising us, we will be able to do anything!</p>
