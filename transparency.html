                    <h4>Suggestion 1:</h4>
                    <p>The library does not have a reference room at present. There are no chairs available to sit.
                        Please arrange atleast a temporary reference room for the library:-</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Response:</h4>
                    <p>One of the most peaceful places to sit and study is Library. But in our library, there is no
                        place to sit. It is completely filled with books. So it is not really possible to arrange chairs
                        inside. A room close to library is required to make use of it as a study room. But there is no
                        room close to library. There will be problems in taking the book, if the room is not close to
                        the library. So we are working on how to set up a room. We also welcome you to suggest if you
                        have any idea or solution for this. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Suggestion 2:</h4>
                    <p>In Kandi-ODF schedule at night times, there is only half hour gap for the same bus to come from
                        ODF and to go back to ODF and the buses scheduled like this are late by 10-15 minutes daily:-

                    <h4>Response:</h4>
                    <p>We will look into this and make necessary changes. </p>
